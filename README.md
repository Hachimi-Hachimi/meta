# Meta index repository
This repository contains the meta index file which points to the individual translation repositories' index.

# Contributing
Please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Hachimi-Hachimi/meta/issues/new) if you want a translation repository for your own language in the Hachimi organization. Give an overview of your translation experience and list your team members (if any) in the issue.

**NOTE:** As of now, Hachimi's translation tools are not finished yet, which means that there is no good way to create translations currently. However, you can still reserve a repository for your language by creating an issue as mentioned above. They will be reviewed and accepted once the tools are finished.
